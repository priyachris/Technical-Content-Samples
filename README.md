# Technical Writing Portfolio: Sensor Installation Documentation
# Comprehensive Installation Guide Development
I developed a complete sensor installation documentation package that includes multiple formats to meet different user needs:

## Print Installation Guide
* Created a detailed step-by-step installation guide optimized for paper printing<br>
* Designed clear, sequential instructions for straightforward implementation<br>
* Incorporated user-friendly language accessible to installers of all experience levels<br>

## Technical Illustrations
* Developed precise technical illustrations depicting each installation step<br>
* Created visual aids that enhance understanding of complex procedures<br>
* Designed graphics that complement written instructions for comprehensive guidance<br>

## Installation Videos
I produced professional installation videos demonstrating the complete mounting process for sensors and radio devices on various ceiling types:ngs.<br>
**_These videos were created using specialized graphic tools to clearly demonstrate each installation variation._** <br>
Three Mounting Solutions: <br>
Fixture Mount (For installation on light fixtures): https://youtu.be/Xl3VBXxeJCc<br>
Tile Mount (For ceiling tile installation): https://youtu.be/bqIW0-gIFcw<br>
Hard Ceiling Mount(HCM) (For solid ceiling surfaces): https://youtu.be/91LTl8auttU<br>

## Visual Process Demonstrations
I also developed animated GIFs highlighting key installation moments.
Each visual element was carefully designed to provide clear, accessible installation guidance for technicians in the field.

Below are some of the sample gifs of fixture mount installation process<br>

The below video demonstrates surface preparation and fixture mount insertion
