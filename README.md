 i've created the step by step guide for sensor installation<br>

I've created technical illustrations to show the visual installation steps<br>

## Installation videos (Technical illustrations)
I used several graphic tools to make these videos. The videos show how to install sensors or radio devices on different types of ceilings.<br>

There are three ways to mount these devices, depending on what your ceiling is made of:<br>
Fixture Mount: https://youtu.be/Xl3VBXxeJCc<br>
Tile Mount: https://youtu.be/bqIW0-gIFcw<br>
HCM Mount: https://youtu.be/91LTl8auttU<br>

I created a video for each mounting type to clearly show how to install the sensors on these different ceiling surfaces ((Tiles, Fixtures, Hard ceiling)).

Below are some of the sample gifs of fixture mount installation process<br>

The below video demonstrates to prepar the fixture surface to insert fixture mount:

After inserting the fixture mount, the below video demonstrates steps to insert sensor
